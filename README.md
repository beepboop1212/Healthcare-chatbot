# 🏥 Healthcare Chatbot using LoRA Fine-Tuned Gemma

This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune the **Gemma** language model using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for a domain-specific **Healthcare Chatbot**. The goal is to provide accurate, context-aware medical responses while optimizing training resource requirements.

---

### 📌 Project Overview

- **Model**: Gemma (by Google, likely `gemma-7b` or similar)
- **Tuning Method**: LoRA (efficient fine-tuning of large models)
- **Use Case**: Healthcare chatbot – answering medical queries conversationally
- **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers + PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)

---

### 🔧 Features & Capabilities

- Implements **LoRA adapters** to reduce training cost and GPU usage
- Chatbot trained on custom or synthetic **healthcare QA data**
- Capable of handling multi-turn dialogues using a prompt template
- Designed for **instruction-based** interaction style (`<|user|>` / `<|assistant|>`)

### 📂 Notebook Contents

| Section | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Imports | Load all required libraries (`transformers`, `peft`, etc.) |
| 🔄 Dataset Preprocessing | Tokenization and formatting of medical QA dataset |
| 🧠 Model Loading | Load pre-trained Gemma model and tokenizer |
| 🪝 LoRA Configuration | Attach LoRA adapters via PEFT |
| 🎯 Training Loop | Fine-tune model on QA pairs |
| 💬 Inference | Sample prompts and responses from the chatbot |
| 💾 Saving | Save LoRA adapter weights for inference reuse |

---

### 🛠️ Requirements

```bash
transformers >= 4.37.0
peft >= 0.8.0
datasets
accelerate
scipy
```

Use the following to install:

```bash
pip install -q transformers peft datasets accelerate scipy
```

---

### 🚀 Inference Example

```python
prompt = "<|user|> What are the symptoms of diabetes?<|end|>\n<|assistant|>"
response = model.generate(prompt)
print(response)
```

---

### 💾 Model Saving & Loading

You can save and load LoRA adapter weights:

```python
# Saving
peft_model.save_pretrained("lora-gemma-healthcare")

# Loading
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "lora-gemma-healthcare")
```

### 📌 Notes

- This chatbot is **not for real medical use**. It's a demo for educational/NLP research.
- Always consult licensed professionals for health advice.

# 🩻 Healthcare Chatbot using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This project presents a **Healthcare Chatbot** built using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach. The system intelligently answers medical-related questions by retrieving relevant context from a custom knowledge base and generating accurate, context-aware responses.

## 💡 What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** combines the power of:
- **Retriever**: Fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base.
- **Generator**: Generates a natural language response based on the retrieved context.

This hybrid technique significantly improves accuracy and factual grounding, especially in knowledge-intensive domains like healthcare.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- Utilizes a custom dataset or healthcare corpus for response generation.
- Embedding-based similarity search to find the most relevant content.
- Combines retrieval + generation using language models (e.g., GPT variants or other transformers).
- Offers natural language interaction for patients and users seeking medical help.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- LangChain (or similar framework)
- SentenceTransformers / HuggingFace Transformers
- FAISS for vector similarity search
- Streamlit / Jupyter Notebook for interface and prototyping

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install langchain faiss-cpu sentence-transformers transformers

Steps
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-chatbot-rag.git


	2.	Open the Healthcare_chatbot(RAG).ipynb notebook.
	3.	Run each cell to:
	•	Embed documents
	•	Create FAISS index
	•	Query and retrieve relevant context
	•	Generate responses with the LLM

💬 Example Query

User: What are the symptoms of hypertension?
Bot: Hypertension, or high blood pressure, often has no symptoms. However, in some cases...

📌 Notes
	•	This chatbot is a prototype and not intended for real-world medical decision-making.
	•	Always consult a licensed professional for medical concerns.
